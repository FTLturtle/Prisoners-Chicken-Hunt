# Prisoners-Chicken-Hunt
RESTful web-based app that uses a graph data structure to model the spread of behavioral strategies between agents in a variety of classic 2-player symmetric binary choice games (e.g., prisonerâ€™s dilemma, chicken, stag hunt). Model introduces elements of iteration (agents play with each other multiple times in a row), locality(agents only play with those agents they are connected to in the graph), and learning(agents will adopt the best-performing strategy among the strategies of those they are connected to). Includes ability for user to set the location and strategy of the agents and see how the strategies of the agents spread over time.
